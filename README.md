### 🎯 About the Figure

The interactive figure (`07_strategies.html`) provides a **Sankey-based visualization** of preparedness strategies for compound flooding events, extracted from a systematic review of the scientific literature.

It illustrates the **evolution of strategies over time** (2005–2024), grouped into three thematic dimensions:

- 🧠 **Social** (e.g., risk awareness, stakeholder engagement)  
- 🌿 **Environmental** (e.g., nature-based solutions, land use planning)  
- 🛠️ **Technical** (e.g., hydrodynamic modeling, early warning systems)

The visualization reveals how certain strategies have gained prominence in recent years, reflecting changes in research priorities, planning practices, and integrated approaches to flood preparedness.
