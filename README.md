###  About the Figure

The interactive figure (`07_strategies.html`) provides a **Sankey-based visualization** of preparedness strategies for compound flooding events, extracted from a systematic review of the scientific literature.

It illustrates the **evolution of strategies over time**, grouped into three thematic dimensions:

- 🧠 **Social** (e.g., risk awareness, stakeholder engagement)  
- 🌿 **Environmental** (e.g., nature-based solutions, land use planning)  
- 🛠️ **Technical** (e.g., hydrodynamic modeling, early warning systems)

The visualization shoes how certain strategies have gained prominence in recent years, reflecting changes in research priorities, planning practices, and integrated approaches to compound flooding preparedness.
